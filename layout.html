<p>Green Shoppers is an environmental organization dedicated to helping make Malaysia a greener and healthier place to live.
Our social action network connecting nonprofits with people who want to become active in their local community. By taking the
concept of sustainable living beyond the narrow, individualistic approach, we can learn to see our
interconnectedness to our environment and its inhabitants. By getting involved in our communities, by talking to our
neighbours, by supporting local groups, and by re-imagining where we live, we can green not only our own lifestyles, but
our streets, neighbourhoods, towns, cities and, ultimately, our societies. </p>
